1. filter parameters:
	High pass: sigma=7, size=45
	Low pass: sigma=5.3, size=33
	Mix-in ratio: Lowpass(cat):Highpass(dog) = 0.5:0.75

2. Extra works I did in the project:
	Use ":" operator to reduce running time(in line 32&40, etc)
	From line 157-171, I was meant to increase the contrast, but it seems useless, so I commented it out
